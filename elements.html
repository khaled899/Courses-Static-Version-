					<h2>Online Course registration system </h2>
					<p>01.01.2017</p>

				<div class="content">
					<p style="color: white;">Online Course registration is a website that enables students to discover
						various courses to develop interpersonal skills. The site gives the student or user complete
						freedom in choosing the appropriate training courses and their prices, in addition to the places
						as well as the trainer who will study the course. After that, the student or user can fill out
						the registration form in the course he chooses, then an application is sent to join the training
						course for the user and when he agrees The location of the course to join to join, an
						appointment is made for the student to pay the costs of the course..</p>

					<p style="color: white;">Students take a lot of time and effort in searching for training courses
						that help them develop personal skills. It is also difficult to try to find prices that suit all
						individuals. Also, registration in the training course via the manual method can lead to many
						problems such as: Losing forms For students, the loss of forms or the presence of human
						problems, and manual paper registration will take a lot of time and effort.</p>

					<p style="color: white;">The two biggest differences between registering online and mailing in your
						paperwork are time and technology. It can take time when users have to fill in the form, and
						then submit it in some other places. Instead of taking time, technology has helped us to make
						the registration procedure into the next level. You can find more information about the courses
						you want to take and in the same time fill up the form, pay the fees and this system make
						student more comfortable to select courses and prices And That Saves A lot Of time and efforts.
					</p>

					<p style="color: white;">RELATED WORKS PROBLEMS: the system need to response time optimization , the
						optimization of page loading speed and connection time And another indispensable factor is
						Maximum capacity the information is scattered, can be redundant information may be very time
						consuming , Not Periodically Backed Up , doesn’t Provide a connection between the place and the
						user , The system doesn’t provide details about the items , The requires some more feature to
						develop its own and standards , Maximum capacity need to optimization
						, The app should be extended to make it compatible to serve , The system doesn’t provide details
						about the items , not added messaging service And Not add SMS gateway to confirm that customer
						order successfully submitted , The app should be extended to make it compatible to serve a large
						number of user And Another Problems Mentioned in Details in Chapter 2.
						Students can easily register the course in our system without any difficulty and can easily
						understand it, and the time taken to register is less compared to manual enrollment. There are
						options for the student to make his choices and this makes your work easier for you than when
						you register manually. Your information will be stored as soon as you register. This helps
						reduce the time to search for and register for a specific training course. </p>
